  "description": "This port will handle the porting of Ext.data and Ext.util classes, as well as any functionality that doesn't depend on a DOM being present.  It does not handle the porting of the Grid, or any of the classes that require a DOM.  Porting is done with a least-effort basis, so the files are mostly the same, just with an added \"var Ext = ...\" line to make them work.  Do *not* require a sub-module (eg: Ext.util.MixedCollection) directly as none of them actually return anything.",
