This port will handle the porting of Ext.data and Ext.util classes, as well as any functionality that doesn't depend on a DOM being present.  It does not handle the porting of the Grid, or any of the classes that require a DOM.  Porting is done with a least-effort basis, so the files are mostly the same, just with an added "var Ext = ..." line to make them work.  Do *not* require a sub-module (eg: Ext.util.MixedCollection) directly as none of them actually return anything.

There are extensions to the original layout, a rough outline as follows:

* Ext: is now a function that will load more modules, returns Ext
* Ext.game: a collection of modules that add classes and functions to deal with the mechanics of games
* Ext.ux.mongo: Children of Ext.data classes to handle access to MongoDB, requires the `mongo` module.

Examples
===

   var Ext = require('Ext')('Ext.util.MixedCollection');
   
   var mc = new Ext.util.MixedCollection;
   mc.add({id:'x',foo:'bar'})
   mc.add({id:'y',foo:'baz'})
   
   mc.get(1) == mc.get('y'); // true
